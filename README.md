  For this Harry Potter fan site I chose the four house colors from the Harry Potter books
  for the navigation bars in the header and fonts that seemed in keeping with the style of the books.
  
  For the structure I used Bootstrap to create rows and columns in mostly a three-column
  layout.  
  
  The biggest problems I encountered were with getting the images on the site and with formatting - getting the text 
  where it was supposed to be and aligning things and spacing them.
  
  To test the site I checked all the links and the video and audio on mobile, tablet, & laptop.
