  For this Harry Potter fan site I chose the four house colors from the Harry Potter books
  for the navigation bar in the header and a font that seemed in keeping with the style of the books.
  
  For the structure I mostly used Bootstrap to create rows and columns in mostly a three-columns
  layout.  
  
  The biggest problems I encountered were with getting the images on the site and formatting them.
  
  To test the site I checked all the links and the video and audio on mobile, tablet, & laptop.
